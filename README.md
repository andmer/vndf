## Initialization

You need to check out all the submodules in vendor. Instead of doing that
yourself, feel free to add a script that does this for you to scripts.


## Start the server-side components

> ./scripts/server

This will start a recompilation loop. Changes to source files will be detected
and result in a recompilation and restart.


## Start the client

> ./scripts/client


## Deploy to the production environment

> ./scripts/deploy-live
