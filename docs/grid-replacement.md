# Grid Replacement

The grid should be replaced by a bunch of rings centered around the player.

First step:
* There should be outer 3 rings, one for each axis
* There should be another set of smaller rings, close to the player's ship
* The outer rings should be fully visible, but otherwise fill as much of the display as possible
* Consequently, they should stay constant as the camera zooms

Later extensions:
* The rings are marked, showing directions along each in degrees
* The planes the rings lie in a displayed with a very light alpha
* There are concentric lines to mark distance from the player's ship.
* There are straight lines from the inner to the outer rings, marking
  directions.
* Other objects within the rings can have axis-parallel lines between them and
  the ring planes to mark their position in space.
