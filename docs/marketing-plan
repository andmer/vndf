# Marketing

## Active Measures

1. Website

* Main point of reference for everyone wanting to know more about the project.
* Primary purpose right now is to feed to mailing list.

2. Mailing List

* Keeps those interested in the project engaged.
* Can be used as a tool to recruit testers etc.


## Planned Measures

3. Linux Gaming Forums

* As long as the game is Linux-exclusive, we may be able to use this to recruit
  testers and get some initial traffic.

4. Reproductions of interesting planetary system

* Interesting planetary systems, like Jupiter and Saturn, can be reproduced
  realistically in the game's engine.
* These demos can be posted to /r/space and similar forums.

5. Contact YouTubers directly

* YouTube producers that are likely to be interested in the game (like Scott
  Manley) can be contacted directly.
* This implies a certain maturity in the game and readiness for larger exposure.
