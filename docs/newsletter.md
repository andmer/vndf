# Rules

- Emphasize mentions of `<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>` and
  `<em>VNDF</em>`, except in titles.
- Links should open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`). Exceptions to this are
  links that should consume the user's full attention at this point, like links
  to the newsletter signup form. Another exception are the internal anchor
  links.
- Teaser images should be 600x337 (16:9) pixels large

- Sort stories into time-sensitive (needs to go out with next newsletter) and
time-independent (can be used as filler for any newsletter).
