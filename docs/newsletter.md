# Rules

- Emphasize mentions of `<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>` and
  `<em>VNDF</em>`, except in titles.
- Links should open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`). Exceptions to this are
  links that should consume the user's full attention at this point, like links
  to the newsletter signup form. Another exception are the internal anchor
  links.
- Teaser images should be 16:9 (1,77:1) with a width of 600 pixels
