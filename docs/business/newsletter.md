# Rules

- Links should open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`). Exceptions to this are
  links that should consume the user's full attention at this point, like links
  to the newsletter signup form. Another exception are the internal anchor
  links.
- Teaser images should be 600x337 (16:9) pixels large

# Plans

Currently, the newsletter doesn't include an article about a topic each month,
like it used to. If we ever want to do this again, here are a few ideas:

- Stats from the VNDF Git repository
- Recycle short story
- Second inspirations series:
  - Homeworld
  - Factorio
