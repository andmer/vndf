# Story

## Scenario

At the beginning, the main idea for the game's story line was, that the player
would be part of the "Von Neumann Defense Force", a military organization tasked
with defending against an invasion of
[von Neumann probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft),
autonomous spacecrafts capable of creating copies of themselves. Actually, the
probes in VNDF would more acurately be described as
[Berserkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft#Berserkers),
but that doesn't make for a memorable name for the game.

I later hashed out the following details, to support the mechanics I want for
the game:

- The scenario of the game is post-apocalytic. The players are descendants of a
  space-faring civilization that was overrun by von Neumann probes from outside
  of the solar system, a few generations ago.
- The von Neumann probes have set up shop in the inner solar system, where solar
  power is abundant. There they have built up an industry and keep producing
  more copies of themselves, for unknown purposes.
- The Von Neumann Defense Force was the military organization tasked with
  defending against the invasion. It failed.
- Since the war has ended, the remnants of the former civilization have been
  reduced to living in the outer solar system. There they are largely
  undisturbed by the von Neumann probes, as they no longer pose a threat.
- Life in the outer solar system is hard, because solar power is not nearly as
  abundant. Adventurous ship captains regularly venture into the inner solar
  system, to steal fuel and other supplies from the von Neumann probes.

I'd like the tech level to relatively low compared to most science fiction
scenarios. The former civilization would have started colonizing the solar
system, but not have visited other solar systems. I also quite like the style of
the reimaged Battlestar Galactica, with its lack of "magic" technologies (except
the FTL drive, of course).

I also like that focusing on a single solar system would go against the grain of
similar games, and make VNDF more unique.


## Advantages to the Scenario

As I said, beyond the basic idea, I chose this back story to enable specific
game mechanics. Please see
[Mechanics](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/mechanics.md)
for any details. What follows is a short summary of the advantages of this
scenario:

- The scenario is largely static, which means it can be used for a long-running
  game. An invasion scenario would require ongoing development of the backstory
  from us or not nearly be as believable.
- The existance of the former Von Neumann Defense Force explains where new
  players can come by their starter ships. The idea being, that they find and
  repair abandoned wrecks that are still around.
- The lack of resources in the outer solar system, and the hostile force in the
  inner solar system gives players a clear objective.
- Raids into the inner solar system put players into high-pressure situations.
  They go there, lack the fuel to go all the way back, and have to fight heir
  way out.


## Presenting the Scenario Within The Game

I'd like to be the presentation of the scenario be a bit more low-key that is
usual. Players should be shown the lay of the land (you are out here, they are
in there, now go raid!), but I don't think we need to write some kind of intro
movie to explain everything.

The inner solar system should have ruins and such, that tell pieces of the back
story. The player's first ship could have log messages, that tell a bit of its
history as part of the Von Neumann Defense Force.

Players who are interested should be able to piece the story together. But you
shouldn't need to learn the back story to play the game. I always liked this
subtle approach to story telling.


## Who is the Player?

So far I've only talked about the former "civilization". I suggest that we leave
their race an open question, and just never talk about what the players look
like in their ships, or how many limbs they have. I think this has a few
advantages:

- It gives us more freedom in the game design. If NASA confirms that the EmDrive
  is real, we won't be forced to include it in the game to keep it realistic.
- To keep the game believable, we would have to model the solar system after our
  own, which we might not actually want to do, for technical or game design
  reasons.
- I think this should be a game about ships in space. We have the option to
  leave the identity of the player as a mystery, and I think that's what we
  should do (again, I prefer subtle story-telling).


## Player Ships

I suggest that we present player ships as being completely automated, with the
player being integrated into the systems in some way, which we don't need to
specify player. I like this for the following reasons:

- I think if a civilization were advanced enough to colonize its neighbouring
  planets, then it should have reached a point were automated systems are
  cheaper than human workers.
- Humans are a limiting factor in space (radiation, g forces etc.). We are not
  making a movie, so we simply don't need to have people running around.
- With fuel, ammunition, spare parts etc, I believe we already have enough
  angles to make ship management as complex as we wish.
- It won't limit us in the game design. No need to explain what the crew does
  while the player leaves their damaged ship in their rescue pod and comes back
  months later to salvage it.
