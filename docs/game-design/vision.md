# Vision

A multiplayer game about freedom, adventure and hard choices.


## Inspirations

* EVE Online, for its vast scale and the player's ability to create their own
  stories.
* Kerbal Space Program, for its realistic, skill-driven gameplay and the
  player's ability to build their own tools out of simple parts.
* DayZ, for its unforgiving world and meaningful consequences to actions.
* FTL, for using constant pressure to drive stories, which unfold guided by the
  player's decisions.


## Core Goals

1. Mechanics that make player skill the prime condition for success.
2. Players that drive everything that is meaningful about the game.
3. As few arbitrary limitations as possible. Players should only be limited by
   the physics of the game world.
4. No menial tasks. Rule of thumb: If an activity could be performed by a bot,
   it should be automatic.
5. A sense of adventure, accompanied by danger. Forward movement, forced upon the
   player by the constraints of the environment. Think of what FTL does, compared
   to the typical sandbox game (Minecraft, Starbound).


## Type of Game

In my mind, Von Neumann Defense Force always was a strategy game where you
control a single unit, your own ship. What exactly do I mean by this?

- The skill required by the player is tactical and strategic thinking, and
  decision making under pressure.
- Fast reactions are not required. If the player is faced with a new situation,
  they shouldn't be required to react within seconds, or fractions of a second.
  Rather, there are multiple options, one must be chosen quickly, and the best
  time to execute an option is somewhere within the next 30 to 60 seconds.
- Preparation pays off. Choosing the right place and time to fight is just as
  important (or more!) than actually doing well once the fight starts.

I realize there are strategy games that require very fast reaction times and
many clicks per second to play successfully. This is specifically not the kind
of game that I have in mind when I talk about VNDF as a strategy game.


## Realism

Being realistic is not one of VNDF's core goals, but I do think realism has its
place. It can be used to add strategic depth to the game, and can promote player
skill as the prime condition for succes (a core goal), if used correctly.

That said, I don't think the game should add lots of complexity just for the
sake of realism. Realism should be used as a tool, not be an end in itself. For
example, I believe actions in the game should have consequences. We can use
realism to achieve that, by limiting the amount of fuel a ship can carry, and by
requiring fuel for any kind of movement. It should be possible to strand your
big, expensive ship, because you made the wrong decisions or weren't careful
enough.

On the other hand, it doesn't make sense to cripple a player completely for a
single mistake, so it's okay for the escape capsule to have some kind of magic
drive that allows the player to get home without any fuel left.


## NPCs

A lot of games present non-player characters as being peers to the player. This
is often done to further the story by using NPCs to tell parts of it. I think we
shouldn't follow that approach in VNDF:

- VNDF aims to be a sandbox game that is driven by players. NPCs doing stuff
  that somehow drives the game forward should be kept to a minimum.
- If not done well, such NPCs can make the world unbelievable. An example of
  this is EVE Online: Many missions depict the player as interacting with other
  characters that also captain space ships, but behave nothing like other
  players would (Actually that's only one of the many problems that EVE missions
  have from a storytelling perspective. Missions in EVE are basically a parallel
  world that have nothing to do with how the game functions otherwise.)

We can sidestep this whole problem completely by not adding any other "human"
characters. I think we can't really forgo NPCs completely, especially as long as
the game is not popular, and we can't rely on there always being enough players
to provide entertainment for each other.

That's actually one reason I chose the von Neumann probe scenario: They are
artificial intelligences and can be presented as being ant-like, relying on
simple, emergent behaviors and power in numbers, not high-level strategic
decision. I actually see them as part of the environment, not other characters.
