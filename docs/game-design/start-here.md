This directory contains a set of documents describing the game design of Von
Neumann Defense Force. I suggest reading them in the following order:

- [Vision](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/vision.md):
  High-level goals and vision.
- [Story](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/story.md):
  Back story.
- [Mechanics](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/mechanics.md):
  Description of actual game mechanics.
