This directory contains a set of documents describing the game design of Von
Neumann Defense Force. I suggest reading them in the following order:

1. [Vision](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/vision.md):
   High-level goals and vision.
1. [Story](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/story.md):
   Back story.
1. [Mechanics](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf/blob/master/docs/game-design/mechanics.md):
   Description of actual game mechanics.
