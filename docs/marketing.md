# Marketing

## Active Measures

Detailed documentation about active marketing measures is provided elsewhere.
This document only lists the goals of those measures.

### Website

* Provide information to those interested in the project.
* Collect search engine traffic.
* Feed the mailing list. (primary goal)

### Mailing List

* Keep those interested in the project engaged. (primary goal)
* Produce content for the website.
* Serve as a recruitment tool for testers and customers as needed.


## Planned Measures

### Introduction to Orbital Mechanics

* Write a simple simulation software.
* Use that to create a series of videos to explain orbital mechanics.
* The videos can serve as an introduction to more advanced content, like
  webcasts of playin the game.
* They can also funnel people to the website and mailing list.

### Webcasts

* Regularly the game with hand-picked testers and record it. The videos can be
  published on YouTube.
* The goal is to further engage active fans and draw more people to the website
  and mailing list.
* This requires interesting game mechanics, preferably interesting gameplay.

### Linux Gaming Forums

* As long as the game is Linux-exclusive, we may be able to use this to recruit
  testers and get some initial traffic.
* /r/KerbalSpaceProgram's Weekly Misc thread might be a good way to recruit
  testers

### Reproductions of interesting planetary system

* Interesting planetary systems, like Jupiter and Saturn, can be reproduced
  realistically in the game's engine.
* These demos can be posted to /r/space and similar forums.

### Contact YouTubers directly

* YouTube producers that are likely to be interested in the game (like Scott
  Manley) can be contacted directly.
* This implies a certain maturity in the game and readiness for larger exposure.
