Your ship is drifting, seeming almost motionless above the skies of the small,
icy planetoid you are calling home these days. Out here, the sun is only a
slight dot, its role as the great giver of life greatly dimished by the huge
distance. But you make do. Life out here might not be as lush as your people
have been used to for most of their existence, but with ingenuity and hard work
it's possible to make a decent living, even out here.

Still, many vie for more, and you are no exception. What wouldn't you do for
true prosperity, a small taste of the opulence of your people's glorious past?

Fortunately, for an enterprising indiviual such as yourself, it is obvious where
to get all of this. In the inner solar system, billions of kilometers closer to
the sun, lie your ancestral homelands. The cradle of all civilization, where
once your forebears learned to make their first, timid leaps into the great
darkness of space.

All of this is just a memory, of course, and no living being has walked these
worlds in a long time. A generation ago, when the Von Neumann probes descended
upon your homeworlds, bathing their idyllic landscapes in atomic fire, your
people were forced to depart, making new homes for themselves, hidden away in
the outermost reaches of the solar system.

The probes are still there today, basking in the glow of the sun that should be
yours, turning its warmth into energy to be used for a vast industry that churns
out more and more copies of themselves for a purpose known only to them.

You force your attention back into the present. There's no point dwelling in
somber thoughts. Looking towards the future is much more productive, especially
tonight, the night of the big raid.

Sure, you've raided before, but not like this, never this deep into the inner
solar system. This raid is going to be risky, but it also promises a much higher
reward. You and your companions have prepared accordingly, pooling all your
resources to commission brand new ships, spending months on smaller raids to
stockpile enough equipment, fuel and ammunition. Always at the risk of being
discodered and losing it all in one swift strike of retaliation.

But your daring has paid off. Your small, but effective flotilla of four ships
now orbits around its frozen base of operations, ready to go at a moment's
notice. You give the command. In perfect symphony, the ships start the burn of
their main engines, a burn that will both let you escape the planetoid's
gravity, as well as slow your speed relative to the sun, allowing you to fall
down deeper into the solar system.

A few last adjustments, then it's done. Your navigation system shows the curved
course your ship will be taking now, halfway around the sun, passing the
orbits of half a dozen planets and untold numbers of variously sized rocks on
the way. You're right on target for one of the innermost planets, the huge gas
giant near the sun.

In the old days, the next step would have been to wait while your ships drift
towards their aim, letting inertia and gravity do their slow work. Not anymore.
You engage your faster-than-light drives at about the same time your companions
do the same, hurling each of you through space, compressing a journey of months
or even years into a single moment, though only at the cost of most of your
fuel.

You feel a surge of adrenaline at the sudden sight of the gas giant. Just a
moment before it was a small dot at the far end of your screen, now it fills
most of it. Nervously, you check your position and course, praying for your
calculations to be correct. The plan was to jump in close to the planet, both to
evade immediate detection and to use its atmosphere to slow your significant
speed. A minor error has the potential to plunge you deep into the atmosphere
from where there would be no chance of ever escaping.

You release your breath, relieved. The jump was as precise as expected, leading
you on a course that only skims the atmosphere in a daring aerocapture maneuver,
saving valuable fuel. You turn your ship's heavy top-armor forward, just as you
start to feel the vibrations induced by the first gushes of thin gas hitting
your hull. You can't help but wince at the thought of what the thicker layers of
atmosphere will do to that brand-new and still shiny armour. In just a few
minutes, it will be scorched black.

The vibrations turn into shaking, interrupted only by irregular jolts as strong
atmospheric winds hit your ship. Captivated, you watch your navigation screen as
it updates the projected course of your flotilla. Without interference, your
hyperbolic trajectory would have taken you back out of the gas giants sphere of
influence, eventually flinging you back into the outer solar system. Your dip
into the atmosphere causes a severe deceleration, however, and you observe as
the projection changes, eventually turning into an elliptical orbit around the
giant planet, then shrinking, moving the far side of the ellipse closer and
closer.

As the shaking from the atmosphere subsides, the rate of change slows, then
stops, leaving your projected path a near perfect circle. You let out another
sigh of relief as your four ships finally leave the atmosphere, again drifting
peacefully through the soothing vacuum of space. As you reach the other side of
the planet you engage the main engines for a short thrust, ensuring you won't
dip back into the atmosphere on your way around the planet.

You can't help but flash a satisfied smile. It has cost most of your fuel to get
here, but finally you've arrived in your target area, and unharmed at that. Now
all that's left is to raid a few lightly guarded factories, a fuel depot or two
and run like hell, before the probes know what hit them.
