Your ship is drifting, seeming almost motionless above the skies of the small,
icy body you're calling home these days. The waiting made you restless,
impatient. What the hell's keeping them?

Tonight is special. Sure, you've been raiding before, both alone and in company.
But this time is different.  This is not going to be one of the low-risk/
low-reward endevours you've been dealing with before. Tonight you're going to
raid deep into enemy space.

You and your friends have been preparing for weeks. It took as long to save up
for the new, shiny ships, collecting equipment for them, stockpiling fuel and
ammunition. Raiding the inner systems is not for amateurs, and professionals
prepare.

Suddenly, a blip on your screen, then a second, a third one. Finally! Still, the
wait's not over. Nervously, you're checking your ship's systems -yet again-
while the rest of the small flotilla slowly approaches the rendevouz point.
After what seems like an eternity, they finally close in on you, lighting up
their main engines for a few second to synchronize (TODO angleichen?) your
velocities.

TODO Insert info: Orbital maneuvers take time? It wouldn't do to waste your fuel
this early?

Finally it can start. You link up with their navigation systems, taking control
of the small flotilla. The course has already been planned, now you set it into
action. You initiate the single burn with your regular engines that will both
let you escape the orbit of the planetoid, as well as slowing your speed
relative to the sun, letting you fall down deeper into the solar system.

A few last adjustments, then it's done. Your navigation system shows you the
curved course your ship will be taking now, halfway around the sun, passing the
orbits of half a dozen planets and untold numbers of variously sized rocks on
the way. You're right on target for rendevouz with the huge gas giant near the
sun.

Your navigation computer estimates the time of arrival with 6 weeks, but of
course you won't have to wait that long. Like a carefully coreographed dance,
you spool up the fleet's faster-than-light engines and engage at the same time.
Jump!

You reel of the sudden shock as the huge gas giant suddenly fills most of your
screen, having been only one of many symbols on the far side of the solar
system just a second before. You stare at the sensor readouts as they come in,
a thousand worries on your mind. Have your friends jumped at the same time as
you? Have your calculations been correct? A few degrees off, and you'll plunge
directly into the giant planet's atmosphere, instead of grazing just by it like
you planned.

One by one, your worries (TODO Bedenken?) are neutralized (TODO zerstreut?). Your friends
show only a few hundred meters to your side. As the navigation system starts
plotting the new course, you slowly let out your breath, only noticing now that
you had held it. Your course is exactly like you planned, just grazing the
planets thick atmosphere, slowing you just enough - you hope - to get captured
by its gravity well.
