# Monetization

## Eventual Goal

Eventually I'd like to have the following situation:
- Free and time-unlimited trial account with severe feature limitations.
- Full-features accounts for a monthly fee. Each account allows concurrent
  control of a single ship. Instead of "account", we could call this "pilot
  license".
- Explicit support for multiple accounts, available under the same login.


## Von Neumann Friendship Club

After the game becomes interesting but before it becomes ready for regular
commercial operation, there should be a way for enthusiastic players to support
it financially. This could be called the "Von Neumann Friendship Club" and work
as follows:
- One can become a member with a monthly donation (pay what you want).
- The donation amount can be changed at any time.
- Club members receive a private newsletter and possibly get access to a private
  forum.
- After commercial operation starts, the club will be closed for new members.
  Existing members will receive regular gifts to thank them for their support.
