Vision

A space MMO with "freedom" as its central theme.

Inspirations:
* EVE Online, for its vast scale and the player's ability to create their own
  stories.
* Kerbal Space Program, for its realistic, skill-driven gameplay and the
  player's ability to build their own tools out of simple parts.
* DayZ, for its unforgiving world and meaningful consequences to actions.

Core goals:
* Mechanics that make player skill the prime condition for success.
* Players that drive everything that is meaningful about the game.
* As few arbitrary limitations as possible. Players should only be limited by
  the physics of the game world.
* No menial tasks. Rule of thumb: If an activity could be performed by a bot,
  it should be automatic.
