			<h1>
				Unless you love space, science and harsh decisions, leave this
				site right now
			</h1>

			<p>
				I'm serious. If you don't love these things, you don't belong
				here. Go!
			</p>

			<p>
				Listen, friend, I don't mean to be rude. It's not that I don't
				want you here! Quite the contrary! I'm just looking out for you.
				All I want is not to <strong>waste your time</strong>!
			</p>

			<p>
				Look at how this thing is going so far: We're already down in
				the third paragraph and I <strong>haven't even started</strong>
				talking about what this site is actually about. I'm sure we've
				already lost half of the readers to boredom on the way here. By
				today's internet standards, <strong>this is going to be
				long</strong>!
			</p>

			<p>
				Ok, have I done it now? Everyone who doesn't love <strong>
				space</strong>, <strong>science</strong> and<strong> harsh
				decisions</strong> is gone? Great! I'm sure <strong>
				you</strong>, the one reader that hasn't run off yet to read
				some tweets or something, are really excited to finally find out
				what I'm on about. Well, I hope you're a patient guy or gal,
				because I'm going to take a long detour first.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, you've probably played some sandbox games before, right?
				Something like <a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> or
				<a href="http://playstarbound.com/">Starbound</a>? Well, I have
				and I love it! The <strong>freedom</strong>, the <strong>
				adventure</strong>, the limitless potential! You won't believe
				the hours I've spent in those games just exploring and building!
				(then again, maybe you will)
			</p>

			<p>
				But it's not all ponies and roses with those sandbox games! As I
				keep building and exploring, I always reach the point, where I
				look at what I'm doing and notice that what used to be <strong>
				fun</strong> somehow has turned into <strong>work</strong>. Not
				that I have anything against work. I love work! But even though
				I love it, work is <strong>not really what I'm looking for in a
				computer game</strong>! Especially, if it's not the fun kind of
				work.
			</p>

			<p>
				So what is it that turns these games from fun into work? I can't
				really tell what would do that for you, but I know what does it
				for me: <strong>Challenge</strong> or rather, the lack thereof.
				To this day, I like to remember that Minecraft server me and my
				friend played on: We spawned in the ocean, found a tiny island
				and almost starved to death before we managed to craft a fishing
				rod and caught some fish, literally in the last minute.
			</p>

			<p>
				We survived thanks to <strong>tenacity</strong> and <strong>
				teamwork</strong>. It was awesome! Later we built a huge castle
				with all kinds of stuff in it. At some point, I got bored and
				stopped playing.
			</p>

			<p>
				What I want is challenge. Do you know a game that can give me
				that? I know one! It's <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">
				FTL</a>. I think I love FTL even more than I love Minecraft. Not
				only is it difficult it also forces me to make <strong>harsh
				decisions</strong>. (Is this reference to this site's title a
				sign that this detour is about to end? <strong>Oh yes it
				is</strong>! In just a few more long-winded paragraphs...)
			</p>

			<p>
				FTL will offer you this awesome gun that may help you win the
				game, but guess what, if you buy it, you won't have any money
				left to repair your damaged hull. Will you buy the weapon, and
				maybe die in the next fight? Or will you repair your hull and
				die later, when your weaponry will be too underpowered to do
				anything against the tougher enemies in the later sectors?
			</p>

			<p>
				Maybe you'll survive the next few fights and maybe you'll have
				another change to repair your hull then. Or maybe you can get a
				really good weapon later, before the enemies become too tough.
				The thing with FTL  is, you don't know, but you have to <strong>
				decide now</strong> and there are <strong>no do-overs</strong>.
				This one decision can lead you to death or to victory. And
				either way, <strong>you will be the only one to blame for
				it</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				By constantly challenging you, constantly driving you forward,
				FTL makes you write <strong>your own memorable stories</strong>.
				But as good as FTL is, <strong>it is not a sandbox</strong>
				game. It also <strong>won't let you play with your
				friends</strong>. I want to play a game that lets me do <strong>
				all</strong> those things, without any of the downsides!
			</p>

			<p>
				So what exactly do we want? (Yes, I'm saying <em>we</em>. You're
				part of this now.) Let's reiterate.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					We want an <strong>open-world sandbox game</strong> that
					evokes feelings of <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>
					adventure</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					But we also want <strong>to be challenged</strong>! We want
					a game that forces us to make <strong>harsh decisions
					</strong>, thereby enabling us to <strong>write our own
					story</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					This game must be a multiplayer game, so we can <strong>
					share that experience with our friends</strong>. You know
					what, while we're at it, let's make it a <strong>full-blown
					MMO</strong>!
				</li>
				<li>
					And because we <strong>love science and space</strong>, we
					want this to be a science fiction game. Not any old sci-fi,
					no, <strong>we want hard science</strong>. Unless this game
					forces us to learn how to do a <strong>Hohmann transfer
					</strong> or how to get a capture by use of <strong>
					aerobraking</strong>, then we won't even bother!
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				I'm sure I've got you all hot and bothered now, but <strong>
				please calm down</strong>. I've got bad news for you: <strong>
				This game doesn't exist</strong>. Even worse, I don't even know
				if it can exist. It might not be possible to create this game.
				All of this may simply be <strong>too good to be true</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I don't know, if this game is possible, but there's one thing I
				do know: <strong>I want to find out</strong> if it is, and
				<strong>I'm willing to spend a significant chunk of my life to
				do so</strong>! In fact, I already have spent a <strong>huge
				amount of time</strong> working on this game. (not to speak of
				the time I spent on this long-ass sales pitch you're reading
				right now)
			</p>

			<p>
				I will find out, if a game like this can exist. Maybe you want
				to find out, too? Well, here comes the good news: You can find
				that out pretty easily, by <strong>subscribing to my newsletter
				</strong> and then just waiting for a long time, I guess.
			</p>

					placeholder="Enter your Email"
					type="text" />
				<input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
			</form>

			<p>
				Maybe you don't want to subscribe to my newsletter? Maybe you
				don't just give your email address to random strangers on the
				internet? That's fine! I have a solution for you, too. That
				solution is to <strong>come back here every day</strong> and
				<strong>read the whole page again</strong>. I'm pretty sure if
				something significant happens, I will write about it here, too.
				Maybe.
			</p>

			<p>
				Or you could, you know, just <strong>suscribe to my
				newsletter</strong>? It's easy and I won't sell your address, I

			<p>
				The game is still in <strong>really early development</strong>,
				but there also has been a significant amount of progress. So
				much progress, in fact, that <strong>it already has a
				name</strong>. That name is
			</p>

			<h1>Von Neumann Defense Force.</h1>
