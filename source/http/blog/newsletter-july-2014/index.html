					<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

					<p>
						This is the first <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>
						newsletter, which seems like a good occasion to talk
						about the origins of VNDF, how it came to be and what
						happened since then.
					</p>

					<p>
						For many years <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> had
						been an idea in my head, one I occasionaly talked about
						with friends but otherwise never acted on. All this
						changed in April of 2013. I finally started actual work
						on the project! The first piece of work I finished was a
						document named GOALS, painting the project's vision in
						broad strokes:
					</p>

					<code>
						1. Hello World<br />
						2. ???<br />
						3. Space MMO<br />
					</code>

					<p>
						For those in the audience not familiar with computer
						programming, the first step describes the traditional
						first milestone that almost every software project of
						significance will start with: A simple program that
						does nothing more than print <em>"Hello, World!"</em>
						(or something equally simplistic) to the screen.
					</p>

					<p>
						I immediately went on to master that first step, and
						while I don't have anything yet that could be described
						as an
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">
						MMO</a>, I'm proud to report that after almost 15 months
						of on-and-off work and exactly 2799 changes made to the
						project code, I'm firmly into step 2.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the beginning, <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> was
						written in
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">
						C</a>, a venerable programming language that lacks many
						of the comforts its more modern descendants bring to the
						table, but is unsurpassed in many respects and thus
						still has its place in a lot of programmer's toolboxes.
						In the beginning I made slow but steady progress,
						figuring out how to approach the basic systems required
						by a multiplayer game: Network communication, 3D
						rendering, understanding player input and the like.
						While all of this was great fun, my choice of
						programming language showed its drawbacks: Many basic
						tools that are already provided by more modern languages
						are not provided by C, so I needed to figure a lot of
						things out for myself that otherwise would have been
						ready to use.
					</p>

					<p>
						A lot of that changed towards the end of 2013:
						<a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, another
						programming language which had been on my radar for a
						while was finally approaching a point were it was
						becoming usable. Rust is a pretty new language that is
						being developed by <href="https://www.mozilla.org/">
						Mozilla</a>, the fine people that also bring us the
						Firefox web browser. In some ways, it is almost the
						opposite of C: Where C is old and established, Rust is
						young and unproven. However, in constrast to a lot of
						other programming languages that have been developed
						since C appeared in the 70's, Rust allows the programmer
						to control the computer very precisely, like C did, but
						doing so in a novel way that is much safer to use,
						preventing many of the mistakes that C would allow.
					</p>

					<p>
						So I decided to make a bet on Rust and started rewriting
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> in this new language,
						a process that would take me a few months (I don't
						remember exactly, but I think I was finished around
						February or March 2014). So far I'm very happy with this
						decision, and after the initial time investment of the
						rewrite, my bet is starting to pay off, allowing me to
						do a lot of things better and more efficiently than I
						otherwise could have.
					</p>

					<p>
						Which brings us to today. In the months since I finished
						rewriting the project in Rust, I have added new
						features, refined existing ones and continued my overall
						work of figuring out how to create a multiplayer game
						that meets my vision. While I'm still working on the
						technical fundamentals (and will continue to do so for a
						while), the rough outline of a game is starting to
						appear in front of me. I hope that over the next few
						months I can get this project into a state that is
						capable of conveying to you a hint of my vision and what
						this game can become. Until then, you will have to
						contend yourself with my vague descriptions, which I
						plan to expand on over the next few newsletters...
					</p>

					<p>
						...unless you are a <a href="#subscribe">newsletter
						subscriber</a>, of course! Newsletter subscribers can
						already try out an early prototype and see the current
						lack of game with their own eyes, in all its
						embarrassing detail.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The last month was a slow one. Unfortunately, this thing
						called "money" and my ongoing efforts to obtain some of
						it have required a large amount of my attention.
					</p>

					<p>
						Aside from that, marketing has been on my mind! While
						the project is not nearly ready to actually show to
						people (I show it to <a href="#subscribe">newsletter
						subscribers</a> anyway, against my better judgement),
						I expect I'll need some early testers within the next
						few months, so it's as good a time as any to start
						drumming up some attention.
					</p>

					<p>
						The prime example of my marketing efforts is certainly
						this newsletter you're reading right now. I've also
						spent some time to write some <a href="http://vndf.de/">
						marketing copy</a> to get people to subscribe to the
						newsletter, but I'm not very happy with it. I don't
						think it gets my point across at all. I'm currently
						working on a replacement which turned out to be a lot of
						work but should be finished soon, so stay tuned!
					</p>

					<p>
						With all these distractions, not a lot has happened with
						the actual development of the game. I've cleaned up some
						of the game logic code, which will make future work in
						this area much easier, but otherwise doesn't have any
						visible results. I've also started work on improving my
						development infrastructure. I won't bore you with the
						details, but over the last few months, the time it takes
						for me to see a change that I've made in the actual game
						has increased a lot, as the project grew bigger and more
						complex. This means it takes me longer to be able to
						test stuff, which makes me less effective.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the time the August newsletter arrives, I hope to
						have finished the replacement for the current website
						text. The improvements to my development environment
						should also be done. After that, I'll get back into the
						development of new features. I hope to be able to
						publish a first prototype at some point, but right now I
						have no idea how long that will take. One thing is for
						sure though, you'll hear all about it here!

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					Of course, my recent exploits are not the only thing that
					have been happening. Maybe some of the following will be of
					interest to you!

					<p>
						Do you know <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">
						Kerbal Space Program</a>? If you don't, what are you
						still doing here? Go check it out right now! Even if you
						do know it, you probably should check back soon. It
						looks like the guys over at Squad are gearing up for
						the next release and boy, does it look good! Check out
						their
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5UiTqBCNQk">
						latest video</a> for a taste!
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>New Horizons</strong>, the NASA spacecraft that
						launched in 2006,
						<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/14jul_pluto2015/">
						will arrive at Pluto in a year</a>! It's suprising how
						little we know about that little ex-planet, so lots of
						interesting findings are guaranteed.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is not news anymore, but I really like
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC4u0clEc0">
						this video of Huygens landing on Titan in 2005</a>.
						History was made that day!
