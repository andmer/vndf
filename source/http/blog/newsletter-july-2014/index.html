					<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

					<p>
						This is the first <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>
						newsletter, which seems like a good occasion to talk
						about the origins of VNDF, how it came to be and what
						happened since then.
					</p>

					<p>
						For many years <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> had
						been an idea in my head, one I occasionaly talked about
						with friends but otherwise never acted on. All this
						changed in April of 2013. I finally started actual work
						on the project! The first piece of work I finished was a
						document named GOALS, painting the project's vision in
						broad strokes:
					</p>

					<code>
						1. Hello World<br />
						2. ???<br />
						3. Space MMO<br />
					</code>

					<p>
						For those in the audience not familiar with computer
						programming, the first step describes the traditional
						first milestone that almost every software project of
						significance will start with: A simple program that
						does nothing more than print <em>"Hello, World!"</em>
						(or something equally simplistic) to the screen.
					</p>

					<p>
						I immediately went on to master that first step, and
						while I don't have anything yet that could be described
						as an
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">
						MMO</a>, I'm proud to report that after almost 15 months
						of working on the project on and off, I'm firmly into
						step 2.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the beginning, <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> was
						written in
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">
						C</a>, a venerable programming language that lacks many
						of the comforts its more modern descendants bring to the
						table, but is unsurpassed in many respects and thus
						still has its place in a lot of programmer's toolboxes.
						In the beginning I made slow but steady progress,
						figuring out how to approach the basic systems required
						by a multiplayer game: Network communication, 3D
						rendering, understanding player input and the like.
						While all of this was great fun, my choice of
						programming language showed its drawbacks: Many basic
						tools that are already provided by more modern languages
						are not provided by C, so I needed to figure a lot of
						things out for myself that otherwise would have been
						ready to use.
					</p>

					<p>
						A lot of that changed towards the end of 2013:
						<a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, another
						programming language which had been on my radar for a
						while was finally approaching a point were it was
						becoming usable. Rust is a pretty new language that is
						being developed by <href="https://www.mozilla.org/">
						Mozilla</a>, the fine people that also bring us the
						Firefox web browser. In some ways, it is almost the
						opposite of C: Where C is old and established, Rust is
						young and unproven. However, in constrast to a lot of
						other programming languages that have been developed
						since C appeared in the 70's, Rust allows the programmer
						to control the computer very precisely, like C did, but
						doing so in a novel way that is much safer to use,
						preventing many of the mistakes that C would allow.
					</p>

					<p>
						So I decided to make a bet on Rust and started rewriting
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> in this new language,
						a process that would take me a few months (I don't
						remember exactly, but I think I was finished around
						February or March 2014). So far I'm very happy with this
						decision, and after the initial time investment of the
						rewrite, my bet is starting to pay off, allowing me to
						do a lot of things better and more efficiently than I
						otherwise could have.
					</p>

					<p>
						Which brings us to today. In the months since I finished
						rewriting the project in Rust, I have added new
						features, refined existing ones and continued my overall
						work of figuring out how to create a multiplayer game
						that meets my vision. While I'm still working on the
						technical fundamentals (and will continue to do so for a
						while), the rough outline of a game is starting to
						appear in front of me. I hope that over the next few
						months I can get this project into a state that is
						capable of conveying to you a hint of my vision and what
						this game can become. Until then, you will have to
						contend yourself with my vague descriptions, which I
						plan to expand on over the next few newsletters...
					</p>

					<p>
						...unless you are a <a href="#subscribe">newsletter
						subscriber</a>, of course! Newsletter subscribers can
						already try out an early prototype and see the current
						lack of game with their own eyes, in all its
						embarrassing detail.
