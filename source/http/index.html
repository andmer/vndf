				<strong>Von Neumann Defense Force</strong> will be a multiplayer
				game about freedom, adventure and hard choices. Set in a
				post-apocalyptic solar system, each player will control their
				own spacecraft, struggling for survival in a grim environment
				full of dangers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Featuring realistic space travel, intelligent, strategic and
				skill-driven gameplay and harsh consequences for making the
				wrong choice, Von Neumann Defense Force won't be a game for
				everyone. It won't hold your hand, won't send you on quests and
				won't guide you on a carefully designed path of advancement. It
				will be a much rawer, less diluted experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				All of this will be set in a single, constantly running game
				world where you play with - or against - the other players.
