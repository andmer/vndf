					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno, VNDF's lead
						developer and chief newsletter engineer.
					</p>

					<p>
						As the title says, this has been a rather uneventful
						month. I've recently picked up a new client (I'm a
						freelancer) and am still adjusting to my new schedule.
						Still, progress on VNDF hasn't halted fully. Here's
						what's been going on this month:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#new-format">New Newsletter Format</a>:
							As part of my ongoing quest to make me finishing
							this game a realistic prospect, I've decided to cut
							back the time spent on the newsletter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#logging">Logging Infrastructure</a>:
							I've been hunting for a persistent bug that's been
							eluding me for a while. Better logging should help
							me out.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#small-fixes">Small Fixes</a>:
							A few small annoyances have been fixed.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						VNDF in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?

					<h1>New Newsletter Format</h1>

					<p>
						Ensuring a successful outcome for Von Neumann Defense
						Force, despite the amount of work it requires and the
						limited time I can spend on it these days, has been an
						ongoing concern for me. Those last few months, I've been
						cutting down on work where I can, and now it's time to
						question how I can reduce the monthly work of getting
						this newsletter out.
					</p>

					<p>
						<a
							href="http://www.vndf.de/news/newsletter-march-2015/"
							target="_blank">
							A few months ago</a>,
						I already announced that I wasn't going to write a new
						article for every newsletter any more, since that had
						been the most difficult and time-consuming thing. From
						today on, I'm cutting out the articles for good. In
						addition, the news section at the end is also gone. That
						only leaves the most important thing: The development
						update, to let everyone know what's going on month to
						month.
					</p>

					<p>
						Whether you like this change or not, please
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">let me know what you
						think</a>!

					<h1>Logging Infrastructure</h1>

					<p>
						One thing that's been ongoing for a while now is the
						hunt for a very persistent bug: From time to time, I was
						logging into my server to find that the VNDF server
						process was running completely wild, using 100% CPU.
						It's only been happening very rarely, and thus has been
						difficult to diagnose.
					</p>

					<p>
						In order to find this bug and other similar ones in the
						future, I've been introducing a proper logging
						infrastructure using
						<a
							href="https://github.com/rust-lang/log"
							target="_blank">
							log</a>.
						What this means is, the server process will now print
						out messages for almost everything it does. Since
						different log levels are used, it's quite easy to filter
						out everything non-essential or look at all the details,
						depending on what's required.
					</p>

					<p>
						So far it hasn't helped me with my bug yet, but it's
						good to have around none the less.
					</p>

					<h1>Small Fixes</h1>

					<p>
						With the introduction of the new
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-april-2015"
							target="_blank">
							hybrid interface</a>
						came a few new problems. Among those: Some key presses
						(Backspace and Return) were registered twice and players
						no longer had their own comm id displayed to them.
					</p>

					<p>
						The first problem was a straight-forward bug fix. The
						second was solved by introducing a new command: Players
						can now see their own comm id with the new
						<code>comm-data</code> command.
					</p>
