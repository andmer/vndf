						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">A New Direction</a>: Last month I
							announced I was working on a secret project. This
							month I will tell you what it was and how it will
							change the development of <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings

							might take interest in.
						</li>

					<h1>A New Direction</h1>

					<p>
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em> has always been an
						ambitious project, and I knew that from the beginning.
						This didn't matter that much when I started however.
						Back then I was going through a very stressful time and
						needed a side project to wind down in the evenings,
						something I could tinker on just for fun, without any
						expectation for results.
					</p>

					<p>
						That is not how things stayed, however. Over time, the
						project grew on me. I became much more serious about it,
						committing to see it through to the end. This commitment
						has led me to take a critical look at my progress, and
						it has become clear to me that something needs to
						change.
					</p>

					<p>
						When looking at my progress since I finished
						<a href="/news/newsletter-july-2014/#storysofar">
							rewriting the game in Rust</a>
						I have to conclude that, at the current pace, I'll be
						done around 2050. This isn't acceptable, and I have to
						face the facts: I need to make some serious adjustments
						to the scope of the project.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've been thinking about this for a while, and I think I
						figured out what I can do without compromising my
						overall vision: I've found a way to significantly reduce
						the amount of time spent on the graphics code and
						related areas like user interface and input.
					</p>

					<p>
						To get to the point, I've decided to replace the current
						3D interface with a text-based one, that uses as little
						graphics as possible.
					</p>

					<section>
						<h1>What exactly will that look like?</h1>

						<p>
							As much in-game information as possible will be
							represented as text. For example, instead of
							displaying the positions of ships in the vicinity in
							3D space, there will be a list of nearby ships, each
							with their position, direction and distance in text
							form. There will be (at least initially) no mouse
							input. The game will be controlled with the
							keyboard.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>What do you hope to gain from this?</h1>

						<p>
							This will save me a lot of work on something that is
							really not essential right now. Of course, graphics
							are nice to look at, but without actual game play,
							there's honestly not much point in having them.
							There is a lot of work to be done, and the more I
							can delay or even forgo completely, the better the
							chance I can create something fun and meaningful.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>
							Does this mean graphics are gone from the game
							forever?
						</h1>

						<p>
							No. For one, there are a few concepts that I'm not
							sure I can represent in a purely text-based fashion
							(orbits and navigation in general come to mind).
							For these areas, I'll use graphics sparingly and in
							a way that causes as little work as possible.
						</p>

						<p>
							Also, I'd like to add graphics back to the game
							later, as my resources allow. However, I won't spend
							any time on this until I have a game that is a fun
							and engaging, if something somewhat spartan,
							experience.
						</p>
					</section>

					<p>
						So much for the overall vision. In the
						<a href="#update">Development Update</a> I'll tell you
						all about my progress so far.
					</p>

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						...
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							In the topic (insert link), I've described the new
							direction development has taken.
						</li>
						<li>
							After having worked on this for almost to months, I
							had really hoped to be able to present some
							impressive advancements in gameplay for this
							newsletter.
						</li>
						<li>
							That was not be be, however. The reason? Well, while
							a text-based interface is much easier than a full 3D
							interface, it still takes some time to lay the
							groundwork. But mostly, I've been busy with
							networking infrastructure.
						</li>
						<li>
							At the same time I started working on the new
							text-based interface, I decided to take that chance
							to redo the networking infrastructure. I did this
							because it interests me and because I want to use
							the code and experience gained from this for
							something else I'm working on. From the perspective
							of VNDF, this has been a really dumb move, however,
							as it's a lot of work with no visible progress.
						</li>
						<li>
							No matter, I made some progress, here's the
							screenshot:
						</li>
						<li>
							(insert screenshot)
						</li>
						<li>
							So what's next? I need to finish the networking
							code. This is a lot of work.
						</li>
						<li>
							After that, I still need to figure out some details
							regarding the interface. This should be less work.
						</li>
						<li>
							After that, I'll work on new features! For initial
							testing of the interface I've only built
							communication features that weren't there before.
							This means we lost the ability to actually navigate
							in space, so that's what I'm going to work on next.
						</li>
					</ul>
