					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Inspirations: FTL</a>: In the
							fourth and final installation of the series about
							games that inspire <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em>, I'll talk about a true masterpiece:
							<a
								href="http://www.ftlgame.com/"
								target="blank">
								FTL: Faster Than Light</a>

						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>Inspirations: FTL</h1>

					<p>
						- Very successful game, you might have heard about it
						- If not, make sure you've got a lot of free time before
						  trying it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
						- Very different game from what <em>Von Neumann Defense
						  Force</em> attempts to be on a surface level, but it
						  does a lot of things right.
						- Constant forward movement. Player is constantly
						  pressured.
						- Ups and downs. You never now what is around the
						  corner.
						- This makes for interesting stories.
						- This isn't a game where you try one thing a hundred
						  times until you manage to pass, then move on to the
						  next thing.
						- While <em>VNDF</em> will look nothing like FTL, I want
						  to replicate this feeling of adventure, the telling of
						  your own stories.
						- <em>VNDF</em> won't be a game where you go back and
						  forth for hours, accumulating whatever it is you need.
						- Any attempt to gain something will require you to risk
						  what you already have.
						- You won't be able to climb steadily in <em>VNDF</em>.
						- Your time playing the game will be an adventure with
						  ups and downs, and that will make it all the more
						  interesting.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The weeks leading up to
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-november-2014"
							target="_blank">
							last month's newsletter</a>
						had been a bit slow. Surely this time around I will have
						some better news? Well, kind of.
					</p>

					<p>
						Those last few weeks I've been working like a madman on
						a secret project that might completely change the
						immediate future of <em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>.
						It is an experiment that, if it succeeds, might take the
						development into a new direction. I'm still in the
						middle of this, however, and am not yet ready to talk
						about it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's what will happen: If the experiment succeeds, I
						will have a big announcement ready for you in next
						months newsletter. If it fails, well, I'll have wasted
						6 weeks of development time and will be going back to
						business as usual. One way or another, you'll hear all
						about it right here in one month! Exciting, isn't it?

					<h1>In Other News</h1>

					<p>
						As always, I'm going to close the newsletter with some
						space- and gaming-related news from around the Internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>JAXA</strong> has successfully launched the
						<a
							href="http://www.jspec.jaxa.jp/e/activity/hayabusa2.html"
							target="_blank">
							Hayabusa 2</a>
						mission! If everything goes to plan, the craft will
						arrive at its target, the asteroid
						<strong>(162173) 1999 JU3</strong>, in 2018, land there
						and return surface samples back to earth in 2020.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>NASA</strong> has completed a very successful
						first test flight of its new
						<a
							href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/"
							target="_blank">
							Orion capsule</a>.
						During the 4-hour flight, the unmanned capsule reached a
						distance of about 5800 kilometers from earth, the
						farthest any human-rated spacecraft has gone since the
						last Apollo mission in 1972! I'm not so sure that this
						really is the first step towards a manned Mars mission,
						but it's certainly exciting that NASA is regaining its
						capability of sending humans beyond low Earth orbit.
					</p>

					<p>
						I really like this
						<a
							href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/science/space/curiosity-rover-28-months-on-mars.html?_r=0"
							target="_blank">
							visualization of Curiosity's progress</a>
						in its 28 months on Mars. The video at the top is really
						nice!
