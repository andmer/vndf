					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#topic">Inspirations: FTL</a>: In the
							fourth and final installation of the series about
							games that inspire <em>Von Neumann Defense
							Force</em>, I'll talk about a true masterpiece:
							<a
								href="http://www.ftlgame.com/"
								target="blank">
								FTL: Faster Than Light</a>

						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What happened since the last newsletter and what do
							I plan to work on next? Not much, as it turns out,
							but maybe there's a super-exciting reason for that?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#inothernews">In Other News</a>: Happenings
							from around the web that <em>VNDF</em> aficionados
							might take interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

					<h1>Inspirations: FTL</h1>

					<p>
						- Very successful game, you might have heard about it
						- If not, make sure you've got a lot of free time before
						  trying it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
						- Very different game from what <em>Von Neumann Defense
						  Force</em> attempts to be on a surface level, but it
						  does a lot of things right.
						- Constant forward movement. Player is constantly
						  pressured.
						- Ups and downs. You never now what is around the
						  corner.
						- This makes for interesting stories.
						- This isn't a game where you try one thing a hundred
						  times until you manage to pass, then move on to the
						  next thing.
						- While <em>VNDF</em> will look nothing like FTL, I want
						  to replicate this feeling of adventure, the telling of
						  your own stories.
						- <em>VNDF</em> won't be a game where you go back and
						  forth for hours, accumulating whatever it is you need.
						- Any attempt to gain something will require you to risk
						  what you already have.
						- You won't be able to climb steadily in <em>VNDF</em>.
						- Your time playing the game will be an adventure with
						  ups and downs, and that will make it all the more
						  interesting.

					<h1>Development Update</h1>

					<p>
						The weeks leading up to
						<a
							href="/news/newsletter-november-2014"
							target="_blank">
							last month's newsletter</a>
						had been a bit slow. Surely this time around I will have
						some better news? Well, kind of.
					</p>

					<p>
						Those last few weeks I've been working like a madman on
						a secret project that might redefine the future of
						<em>Von Neumann Defense Force</em>. It is an experiment,
						that, if it succeeds, might take the game in a new and
						exciting direction. I'm still in the middle of it,
						however, and am not yet ready to talk about it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's what will happen: If the experiment is
						successful, I will have a big announcement ready for you
						in next months newsletter. If it fails, well, I'll have
						wasted 6 weeks of my time and will be going back to
						business as usual. One way or another, you'll hear all
						about it here in one month! Exciting, isn't it?
