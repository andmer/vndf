					<h1>Welcome</h1>

					<p>
						Hello, and welcome to this month's <em>Von Neumann
						Defense Force</em> newsletter! I'm Hanno,
						<em>VNDF</em>'s lead developer and chief newsletter
						engineer. This month, I'm going to talk about the
						following topics:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#article">The Best of Both Worlds</a>:
							Yes, I've decided to go with another approach to the
							user interface yet again. Read all about it in this
							month's article.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#update">Development Update</a>:
							What's been going on with the project since the last
							newsletter?
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#news">In Other News</a>:
							Happenings from around the web that <em>VNDF</em>
							aficionados might take an interest in.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Have fun with this month's newsletter and please email
						any feedback to <a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">
						mail@hannobraun.de</a>. Do you have any questions about
						<em>VNDF</em> in general or the contents of this
						newsletter specifically?
						<a href="mailto:mail@hannobraun.de">Let me know</a>!

						<h1>New Project Management Tool</h1>

						<p>
							Keeping up to date with what's happening - and about
							to happen - in the project is very important, and
							since paper gets unwieldy very fast, software is the
							solution to that particular problem. I had been
							using
							<a
								href="http://pivotaltracker.com"
								target="_blank">
								Pivotal Tracker</a>
							for that particular task, and while it's a very fine
							tool, it's also very opinionated. As my process kept
							evolving, the tool served me less and less well.
						</p>


						<p>
							Enter
							<a
								href="http://trello.com"
								target="_blank">
								Trello</a>.
							Everyone who's used Trello knows that it's the Excel
							of web applications. It's extremly flexible and can
							be used to organize all kinds of situations, from
							appartment searches to software development
							processes. Knowing that, I set out to create a
							Trello board that captures my process perfectly.
						</p>

								alt="The Trello board I use for VNDF development" />
							<p>(click to enlarge)</p>
						</a>

						<p>
							I really like this new setup. I have two lists,
							<code>Ideas</code> and <code>Roadmap</code>, for
							high-level concepts that are not perfectly planned
							out yet. Detailed tasks start in <code>Ready</code>,
							when they're ready to be worked on, and move over
							<code>In Progress</code> to <code>Finished</code>,
							giving me a good picture of what's going on. Once
							finished work have been deployed to the live server
							(available to <a href="/newsletter">newsletter
							subscribers</a>), they move into the
							<code>Live</code> list for that calendar week.
						</p>

						<p>
							All in all, this new system gives me a very good
							overview over both what's going on and what's
							planned for later. I'm very happy about how it
							turned out!
