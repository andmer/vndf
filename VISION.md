## Vision

A multiplayer game about freedom, adventure and having to make hard choices.


### Inspirations

* EVE Online, for its vast scale and the player's ability to create their own
  stories.
* Kerbal Space Program, for its realistic, skill-driven gameplay and the
  player's ability to build their own tools out of simple parts.
* DayZ, for its unforgiving world and meaningful consequences to actions.
* FTL, for using constant pressure to drive stories, which unfold guided by the
  player's decisions.


### Core Goals

* Mechanics that make player skill the prime condition for success.
* Players that drive everything that is meaningful about the game.
* As few arbitrary limitations as possible. Players should only be limited by
  the physics of the game world.
* No menial tasks. Rule of thumb: If an activity could be performed by a bot,
  it should be automatic.
* A sense of adventure, accompanied by danger. Forward movement, forced upon the
  player by the constraints of the environment. Think of what FTL does, compared
  to the typical sandbox game (Minecraft, Starbound).


### Next Steps

* Camera zoom
* Path prediction
* UI: Selecting other ships as targets
