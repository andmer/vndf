Print message on server startup. (convenience)
It can be confusing to start up the server for the first time after a while,
because you kinda expect something to happen but nothing does.

Server should restart automatically. (convenience)
If the server crashes for some reason during development, the build script needs
to be restarted manually. It should print a message instead and restart if
automatically.

Client doesn't react quickly to events. (bug)
There's a delay to event processing because the client is blocking on the socket
receive.
