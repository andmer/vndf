This file collects real issues that occured during development or in production.
The following list defines the types of issues that belong in this file. It is
not complete and should be extended as necessary:
* bug: Incorrect behavior.
* convenience: The issue caused programmer inconvenience.

Server should restart automatically. (convenience)
If the server crashes for some reason during development, the build script needs
to be restarted manually. It should print a message instead and restart if
automatically.

Need a simple way to add comments to issues. (convenience)
I feel like managing issue comments in this file will be more trouble than it's
worth. It's probably time to migrate to a real issue tracker.
