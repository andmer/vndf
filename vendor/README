This file used to document what the source of the dependencies here in vendor
is, although it was always incomplete. I've since decided to switch to
submodules. I'm leaving this file until all the dependencies have been upgraded.

Note:       This is a temporary fork. We can go back to upstream
            (https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-stb-image) once the update
            to the latest Rust version is merged
            (https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-stb-image/pull/24).
